Analyze and pull-out phosphorylation data using MS Excel files generated by Proteome Discoverer:

1) Drag and drop all files into a folder you want. I named my folder 'Python'.

2) User should install "Anaconda" if you want to avoid a bunch of errors (https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda may be charging users now, so installing libraries through conda-forge is free and will get you similar packages installed. This installs python modules that are required to run the software.

2) After installing Anaconda, user must install additional modules (third party) by typing the following into Terminal and hitting enter:

    pip3 install regex
    pip3 install XlsxWriter
    pip3 install pandas
    pip3 install requests
    pip3 install svg
    pip3 install pprint

    
3) Add your MS files into 'msfiles' folder within the parent Python folder. Note that it is easier to run the script using simple filenames, such as SBY8253.xlsx or something.

4) Make sure your MS files have the 'Proteins & Peptides' worksheet (tab) as the first tab in the file (all the way to the left). This is the table with the expandable/hidden rows. Otherwise the script will not work.

5) Open terminal, and set working directory to the Python directory using the following command:

    cd directory_path/Python
    
    For instance, if you put Python folder on desktop, you would type:
    
    cd Desktop/python
    
6) To run the phosphorylation analysis, type into Terminal:

    python3 phospho.py
    
Follow the commands. When the analysis is done, the 'output' folder contains the comparison file.
